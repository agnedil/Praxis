You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task: You are given a list of words each of k length and a list of character ranges of k length. The character ranges are expressed as [a-c], [m-o], etc. Each range represents a set of valid characters at that index. Return the subset of words from the list of words that are valid. For example, if you are given a list of words [\"abc\",\"def\"] and a set of ranges [[\"a-d\"],[\"a-c\"],[\"b-d\"]], \"abc\" is a valid word but \"def\" is not. The length, k, will be between 1 and 10 and the ranges can span the whole alphabet, so the algorithm will have to be efficient to take this into account. Write a Python function to return a set with all of the valid words..\n","2. Your output must include only the correct import statements, the function with proper Python code, and and nothing after it.
