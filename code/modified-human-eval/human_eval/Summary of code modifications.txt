Summary of code modifications (all in execution.py):
* Add class DillProcess to fix the pickling issue (uses dill instead of pickle).
* Modify function check_correctness() to have an extra argument use_prompt which controls the exclusion or addition of problem["prompt"] to the Python program to be run. The body of the function is modified to accommodate for the use of use_prompt.
* Modify exception handling to add error tracebacks (helps when the error message is empty).
