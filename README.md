# Praxis

## Instructions
1. Install Dependencies: Ensure you have the required packages installed:

```bash
pip install openai```

2. Download the HumanEval Dataset as the human_eval.jsonl file from the OpenAI HumanEval repository at https://github.com/openai/human-eval/tree/master/data and save it as human_eval.jsonl in the same directory as your script.

3. Download the MBPP Dataset as the mbpp.jsonl file from the Google Research GitHub repository at https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/mbpp and save it in the same directory as your script.

3. Set your OpenAI API Key - export your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'```

4. Run the Script: Execute the script using Python 3:
```bash
python your_script_name.py```



## Important Notes
### Security Warning
1. Executing Untrusted Code: The script executes code generated by an AI model and code from the dataset, which could be malicious. This is a significant security risk.
2. Sandbox Execution: In a production environment, you should execute code in a secure, sandboxed environment (e.g., using Docker containers or specialized sandboxing tools) to prevent potential harm to your system.
3. Restricted Built-ins: The execution environment in the script disables built-in functions by setting __builtins__ to an empty dictionary. However, this is not foolproof and should not be solely relied upon for security.

### API Rate Limits and Costs:
1. Rate Limiting: Be mindful of OpenAI's API rate limits. The script includes a time.sleep(1) call to space out API requests.
Cost Management: Processing the entire dataset can be costly. Consider testing with a subset of tasks or implementing additional logic to manage usage.

### Error Handling:
The script includes basic error handling for API errors and file I/O issues. Enhance this as needed for robustness.

### Model Configuration:
You can change the model by modifying the model parameter in the get_completion function call.

### Execution Timeout:
The execute_code function includes a timeout mechanism. Adjust the timeout parameter as necessary.

### Logging:
Implement logging to a file to keep track of successes, failures, and errors for later analysis.
